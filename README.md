# HackIR

During HackIR, our team consisted of: Brian Chan, Carson Kaucher, and Veronika Nguyen
We created two projects: Hack your Health and also Cryptography Solver

# Hack Your Health
Hack your Health is a project that solves the modern problem of people developing health risk due to overworking.
This health app reminds you to stretch and rest your eyes every couple of minutes and also reminds user for food and water.
An implementation of an pomodoro timer that has a website blocking feature increases productivity and time management as well as
ensure the user to be mind their health by taking breaks.
